# URBANgraph: Intelligence-Driven Logistics Integrity 🛰️

### "Reduciendo el riesgo operativo y los costos de seguros en flotas de alto valor mediante análisis topológico preventivo".

URBANgraph is a mission-critical **Urban Integrity Engine** built for the most demanding logistics operations. We don't just provide routes; we provide **certainty**.

## 🛑 The Economic Problem: The Hidden Cost of Urban Chaos
Every year, high-value logistics enterprises lose millions of dollars due to incidents in "urban shadow zones"—areas where traditional navigation fails to account for safety and topological stress.
- **Unquantified Risk**: Conventional APIs optimize for time, often leading fleets into high-risk bottlenecks.
- **Insurance Erosion**: Rising incident rates lead to unsustainable insurance premiums.
- **Operational Blindness**: Real-time urban threats are often ignored until it's too late.

**URBANgraph quantifies risk before the loss occurs.**

## ⚡ The "Sandoval Formula™" Advantage: Beyond Conventional Maps
Unlike generic navigation services, our proprietary engine generates **Integrity Vectors**.
- **Deep Infrastructure Integration**: We integrate direct real-time feeds from **C5 and ADIP** (Mexico City's surveillance network), processing data from thousands of cameras and panic buttons.
- **Topological Stress Analysis**: Our engine calculates "Urban Stress" using the **Sandoval Formula**, identifying safe corridors that conventional APIs simply ignore.
- **Predictive Intelligence**: We don't just react to incidents; we predict areas of high volatility to ensure your cargo never enters a compromised zone.
